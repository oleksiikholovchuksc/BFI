#BFI: Brainfuck Interpreter
##Make brainfuck, not war
===========
This is a Brainfuck interpreter written in C. 
It is as slow and buggy as I could make (I have worked hard for this, really).

## Usage
	bfi <filename>

## Brainfuck syntax
Just read [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Commands "Brainfuck is sexy").
